Program: Number guessing game (arcade edition)

Program Outline: this will be a game that tests the users luck and knowledge. The player will guess a random
                    number, that the computer generates. If the player guesses it right, they will win tokens,
                    if they incorrectly guess, they will lose the number of tokens they placed for betting.
                    The amount of tokens they win, depends on the difficulty of the level.

Implemented concepts: the concepts I want to implement are; functions, structures, loops and control structures,
                        and the standard library templates. 

Things to consider: 1. the player deposits their tokens to play
                    2. the player can guess a number between certain ranges depending on the difficulty
                            - easier than easy range: 1-5
                            - novice (easy) range: 1-8
                            - intermediate range: 1-12
                            - expert range: 1-20
                    3.  how much a player would win depending on the difficulty
                            - easier than easy range: betting amount * 1 tokens
                            - novice (easy) range: betting amount * 2  tokens
                            - intermediate range: betting amount * 3 tokens
                            - expert range: betting amount * 5 tokens
                    4.  how the user should quit the game
                    5.  functionality features: 
                            - player name 
                            - token deposit (have conditionals such tokens are multiples of 5)
                            - token betting amount (should also be multiples of 5)
                            - number guess
                            - random number generator & how to increase difficulty
                            - when the game should be stopped (ie. if tokens left < betting amount)
